1. Arrays require an overload of the `[]` operator. How does
   that play with pointers to a type that also overloads `[]`?

2. Ambiguity between default void method and abstract void
   method in trait.

3. The meanings of `=`, `&`, `*`. Are they operators, or
   built in? How unfortunate the C pointer creation and
   multiplication are the same symbol.
