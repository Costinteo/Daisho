# What is Stilts?

The goal of this project is to create a language that's nice to work with, looks and feels like Java, but maps to low level C code with manual memory management.

The language is currently still in a planning state. I'm writing the grammar right now, and thinking through how I'm going to accomplish everything that I want to accomplish. Currently I'm going down the rabbit hole of generic type validation semantics and implicit conversions of generic types. Type checking and control flow analysis is going to be the hardest part of this project.


# Design Vision:

## Stilts is:
* The language that Java should have been
* Fast to write, and fast to execute
* Easy to understand
* Easy to write language bindings for
* Focused on tooling and user experience
* A passion project


## Stilts is not:
* Fast to compile
  * This is an eventual goal, but not a priority.
* Supported on platforms other than POSIX
  * I only want to write the standard library and the bootstrapping scripts once. However, it should be pretty easy enough to port. If you're on Windows and you want in on the action, let me know.
* A full time job
  * I already have one. I don't have the time to not make progress. I want more immediate results. That means careful planning and a focus on simplicity.
  

# How can I get involved?

["Hop on over" to the Discord](https://discord.gg/HfP64r7Nxe) if you want some input into the direction of the language, or suggestions, or if you want to help write the thing.

I want to share the results of my work, because writing compilers is hard.
